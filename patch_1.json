The fix replaces MD5 with SHA256, which is a secure hash algorithm recommended by security standards. This change maintains the exact same functionality - creating a hex digest of the title for signature purposes - while addressing the security concern. No other changes are needed as the API remains identical between hashlib.md5() and hashlib.sha256().",
